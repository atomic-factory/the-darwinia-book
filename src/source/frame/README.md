The [Framework][1] for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities (FRAME) is a set of modules (called pallets) and support libraries that simplify runtime development. Pallets are individual modules within FRAME that host domain-specific logic.

FRAME provides some helper modules to interact with Substrate Primitives, which provide the interface to the core client.
