# Balances

`Darwinia Balances` usually mean `KTON` and `RING`, just like what we have already learned from the [introduction](../index.md): 

+ `Ring` is the native token for the Darwinia Network, it can be used as gas for transactions.

+ `Kton` is the other kind token in `darwnia` that can be awarded by locking `RING` for 3 - 36 months in the process of Staking.

`KTON` **can be pledged to receive Staking power, so as to participate in POS mining as well**. Users may Stake via pledging `KTON`. However, if the user takes back his or her staking `KTON`, then the related POS mining will be stopped, and it will take 14 days for the unpledged `KTON` to arrive.
